# MicroMouse
There are 2 Parts to this project
First there is the MazeMaker which is a UI for designing mazes
Second there is the MazeSolver which is supposed to emulate a micromouse solving the maze

## MazeMaker
The goal for this is that it will create a maze on it own but to make it quicker to design mazes manually I created a simple GUI that lets you make the maze. Then the maze maker outputs the maze to a text file that can then be imported by the maze solver.

### How the Manual GUI works


### How the Maze Generating Algorithm works

## MazeSolver
The goal of this is that I will be able to create and test different maze solving algorithms just to learn how to design better algorithms.
### Breadth First Search
Breadth first seach works by expanding its search by one cell in all directions. Another way this can be throught of is as a tree and it is searching the tree row by row.
